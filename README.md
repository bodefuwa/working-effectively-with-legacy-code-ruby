# Working Effectively with Legacy Ruby

Ideas and goals for this repo:

* Translate, where appropriate, concepts and code examples from Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers into idiomatic Ruby
* Collect real-world examples of Ruby code in situations explored in the book
* Provide exercises for refactoring practice

Questions I have:

* Does it really matter what language the examples in the book are? Many of the examples don't make total sense without their context anyway, but still illustrate the ideas. Part of creating this repo is an experiment to see what people who have primarily worked with Ruby think- if having the examples in Ruby makes the ideas clearer and eliminates cognitive overload (eye-glazing-over syndrome) or not.
* Is it realistic for legacy Ruby code to be idiomatic anyway? In my experience, no, but again, would this help eliminate extra cognitive effort to getting to the concepts? If our first step in working with legacy code is to take a minute and fix the whitespace, the capitalization, the style, would these examples just be assumed to be after you take that step?
