# Working Effectively with Legacy Ruby

Ideas and goals for this repo:

* Translate, where appropriate, concepts and code examples from Working Effectively with Legacy Code by Michael Feathers into idiomatic Ruby
* Collect real-world examples of Ruby code in situations explored in the book
* Provide exercises for refactoring practice
